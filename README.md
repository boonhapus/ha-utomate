## Getting Started

The best way to get up and running with `hautomate` in HomeAssistant is with [HACS][hacs] as a [custom repository][hacs-custrepo].

All that's left to do is add hautomate to your `configuration.yaml` with a directive pointing to the directory that holds all your Apps!

```yaml
hautomate:
  apps_dir: /path/to/my/apps/
```

Optionally, if you'd like to just test if your install is working, you may use the constant `hello_world`.
```yaml
hautomate:
  apps_dir: hello_world
```
